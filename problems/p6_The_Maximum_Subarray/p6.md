# The Maximum Subarray

We define subsequence as any subset of an array. We define a subarray as a contiguous subsequence in an array.

Given an array, find the maximum possible sum among:

- all nonempty subarrays.
- all nonempty subsequences.

Print the two values as space-separated integers on one line.

Note that empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.

Sample Input 

```
2
4
1 2 3 4
6
2 -1 2 3 4 -5
```
Sample Output 

```
10 10
10 11
```

Explanation 

In the first case: The maximum sum for both types of subsequences is just the sum of all the elements since they are all positive.

In the second case: The subarray [2,-1,2,3,4] is the subarray with the maximum sum, and  [2,2,3,4]  is the subsequence with the maximum sum.
